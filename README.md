This is the code repo for Catan, a CPU scheduling framework for Robotics and AR/VR systems. This work has been published at IROS'22. [Here's](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13280) the arXiv version of our paper.

Catan takes as input application performance goals, and automates CPU scheduling decisions (such as mapping tasks to cores, and setting task frequencies). Catan also adapts to varying CPU usage and availability. Our results show that Catan achieves 8x better collision avoidance than manually-tuned CPU scheduling for Robot Navigation application. We also have results for a face tracking app and a VR system running on ILLIXR.
