/**
 * @brief A manager for typesafe, threadsafe, named event-streams (called topics).
 *
 * - Writing: One can write to a topic (in any thread) through the `ILLIXR::writer` returned by
 *   `publish()`.
 * 
 * - There are two ways of reading: asynchronous reading and synchronous reading:
 *
 *   - Asynchronous reading returns the most-recent event on the topic (idempotently). One can do
 *     this through (in any thread) the `ILLIXR::reader_latest` handle returned by
 *     `subscribe_latest()`.
 *
 *   - Synchronous reading schedules a callback to be executed on _every_ event which gets
 *     published. One can schedule computation by `schedule()`, which will run the computation in a
 *     thread managed by switchboard.
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * void do_stuff(switchboard* sb) {
 *     auto topic1 = sb->subscribe_latest<topic1_type>("topic1");
 *     auto topic2 = sb->publish<topic2_type>("topic2");
 * 
 *     // Read topic 3 synchronously
 *     sb->schedule<topic3_type>("topic3", [&](const topic3_type *event3) {
 *         // This is a lambda expression
 *         // https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda
 *         std::cout << "Got a new event on topic3: " << event3 << std::endl;
 *     });

 *         // Read topic 1
 *         topic1_type* event1 = topic1.get_latest_ro();
